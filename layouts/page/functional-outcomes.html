</h2>
 <p>Functional outcomes are important measures in a patient’s recovery.<br>
They focus on what a patient can do in their everyday lives<br>
… life skills, work, school, and relationships.
</p>

  <p>Functional outcomes are different than clinical outcomes, <br>
such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels <br>
or the symptoms a patient has because of an illness or injury.
