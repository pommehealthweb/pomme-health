 <center><h2>What are Functional Outcomes?
</h2>
 <p>Functional outcomes are important measures in a patient’s recovery.<br>
They focus on what a patient can do in their everyday lives<br>
… life skills, work, school, and relationships.
</p>

  <p>Functional outcomes are different than clinical outcomes, <br>
such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels <br>
or the symptoms a patient has because of an illness or injury.

  <center><h2 class="margin-bottom">Why are Functional Outcomes important?

</h2>
 <p>Functional outcomes are important to measure because<br>
they tell you how a patient is functioning day-to-day.</p>

  <p>This functioning is not always determined by a patient’s diagnosis 
or the clinical symptoms they present with.</p>

<p>Two different patients with a stroke can function very differently.
Two different patients with depression can function very differently.</p>
