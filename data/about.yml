history:
  text: >-
  
    When Dr. Cheryl Netterfield worked as a Reg Force physician for the Canadian
    Armed Forces, she was concerned that collaborative health care to soldiers
    with complex issues was not optimal. She discovered that valuable
    information was not communicated well between all of the health care
    providers. During interdisciplinary case conferences, it was evident that
    the sharing of information for the care of the patient was not efficient.


    POMMe-Health, a customizable communication platform, was created to address
    the issue of inefficient provider and patient communication and
    collaboration.


    POMMe stands for “Patient Outcome Management and Measurement”. The app
    provides an adjunct tool for health care providers to work better
    collaboratively and thereby, enhance patient outcomes.


    POMMe-Health, Inc is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.
