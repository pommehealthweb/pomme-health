# Collaborative

Interdisciplinary teams don’t communicate effectively. They are busy and don’t speak the same language.

As a result, the health care team is not truly aware of how well the patient is functioning.

Relevant information is hidden in the medical files as providers work in silos.

Allowing all providers and the patient to speak the same language allows for true collaboration. Working together allows for better informed decision making.

Together, we are greater as a whole.
