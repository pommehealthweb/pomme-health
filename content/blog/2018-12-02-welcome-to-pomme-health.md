## Welcome to POMMe-Health!

Welcome to the first blog for POMMe-Health! It is indeed an exciting time for us as we continue to develop and test our app.

This all started when I was working as a Medical Officer for the Armed Forces. For many years, I took care of soldiers who were seriously injured in battle. They had both physical and mental health injuries and were complex in so many ways. All the care providers would meet on a regular basis as the “Circle of Care”, but I never found those meetings very efficient. I always left the meeting believing that there was information that wasn’t being shared. This was not intentional, of course; it was just the nature of busy and hectic work days of all health care providers. Also, I was usually the physician overseeing the health if this soldier; the facilitator of the many health care providers.

Truly collaborative care should be greater than the sum parts of the collated information. Unfortunately, this is not how we practice medicine at all. In fact, we should stop “practicing medicine” and start to “deliver better health care!” It has become my passion to provide a tool by which health care providers can share information and collaborate to provide better health care. We can make better decisions if we have all of the information, if we know what is really relevant. How about we also add what the patient thinks? Is this revolutionary … I think not! It is called patient-centric care and is the standard by how we should all work together.

POMMe-Health is an amazing health care app that has the potential to change the way we approach health care of complex patients. This is even more critical for patients with many care providers. How often have you heard a patient or family member say: “I wish my health care providers would just talk to each other”?

Let’s get everybody on the same page and share our ideas and our information.

Let’s make an action plan for a patient that includes their input.

Let’s ensure that patients can have optimal functioning.

Let’s envision the best quality of life for all!



Stay tuned for fabulous developments.
