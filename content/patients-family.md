Diagnoses are just labels.

A patient's functionality and quality of life should never be defined by their diagnoses.

POMMe looks at all of the biological, psychological and social factors ... a true bio-psycho-model.

Environment and social factors are frequently not considered when making important care decisions. POMMe gathers this information and allows care providers and the patient to make well-informed care plans.
